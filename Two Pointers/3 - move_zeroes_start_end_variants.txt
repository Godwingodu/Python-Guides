This sort of problem can be solved using 2 approaches => 1 - 'Lumutos Partition' and 2 - 'Hoare's Partition' .
Lumutos Partition's problems can be solved using Hoare's Partition .
Both approaches are good so one can choose between .

Possible Variants :-

1. Move Odd or Even numbers
    arr[i] % 2 == 0  => even
    arr[i] % 2 != 0  => odd

2. Move all numbers less than a particular number K
    arr[i] < K 

3. Sort an array of 0's and 1's
    arr[i] == 0      => ascending sort
    arr[i] == 1      => descending sort

4. Move negative or positive numbers
    arr[i] < 0       => negative number
    arr[i] >= 0      => positive number

5. Remove occurancies of a specfic number from array (K)
    arr[i] != K    

6. Remove duplicates from sorted array
    arr[i] != arr[i+1]  
                     => After sorting array if there is duplicate elements they will be adjacent to each other .
                        in that case we use this logic it will remove duplicates the 1st duplicated ele will be removed
                        and the second one of the same remains
